## Batch Distillation:
A script that provides time and amount of charge remaining for a batch distillation process when given initial charge, charge/distillate compositions, boilup rate, and a reflux ratio. This is traditionally done using an iterative approach using integration techniques such as the trapezoidal method. This script uses rectangular summation since that is what many students learn first.
